Nagel. *Towards Computational Performance Engineering for Unsupervised Concept Drift Detection - Complexities, Benchmarking, Performance Analysis*. Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Data Science, Technology and Applications (DATA).

**Structure:**

- data - data for the experiments
- experiments
    - baselines
    - benchmark
    - performanceAnalysis
- uDD
    - iks - additional code for iks drift detection
    - studd - drift detection, model definition, and baselines
- requirements.txt - python requirements
- README.md - this file

Experiment setups for baselines and benchmarks consist of Python files for running the experiment. All experiments additionally consist of a `submit.sbatch` file for running on the ZIH HPC machine. Note, for performance analysis we utilize the same python files as for benchmark.

`uDD` directory consists of an adapted version of studd[1] to provide only necessary functionalities. We use studd's infrastructure for our workflows and the studd drift detection for the benchmark. `iks` directory provides the iks drift detection functionalities as provided by[2].

**Installation:**

*install all required packages*
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

*install scorep (for performance analysis)*
```pip install -t scorep scorep```

*install scorep-dummy (for benchmark but keeping the same files)*
```pip install -t scorep-dummy scorep-dummy```

Note: either add the path to scorep-dummy (benchmark) or scorep (performance analysis) to PYTHONPATH depending on the experiment to run.
